##  Async Training
The goal here is to compute the average value of all the client.
Each client has a different compute speed than the other clients, depending on the 'compute time' distribution (Normal, Exp, Uniform).
This toy example simulates an asynchronous (federated) learning system.
With some extensions, this should be able to run as a simulation on a GPU.

Run `exp.ipynb` for results
